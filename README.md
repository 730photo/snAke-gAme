<h5>
I built a game that I used to play on my Nokia cell phone. It's a game called Snake. <br>
When the game starts, the snake is already in motion and you have to use the arrow keys to try and get the food. Once you get the food the snake gets bigger & a little faster and the food is placed somewhere else. The game is over when you run into the wall or if you make the snake run into itself, an alert will show up on the screen to signal that the game is over.
